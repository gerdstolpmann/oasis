Library liba
  Modules:                   Mod1
  Path:                      liba
  Build:                     true
  CompiledObject:            byte
  CCLib:                     -linvalid
  Install:                   false

Executable t
  Path:                      .
  MainIs:                    main.ml
  Build:                     true
  CompiledObject:            byte
  Install:                   true

# The point is here that "t" doesn't have any dependencies.
# We also have a library liba which is broken, and cannot
# be used (because of -linvalid), although the build is
# expected to succeed.
# The wrong behavior is that it is tried to link liba into t.
